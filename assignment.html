         Principle of Clarity in Ideas: It's essential for the sender to have a clear understanding
         of what they want to communicate. When thoughts are clear, communication becomes more effective.
         Terry emphasizes the importance of fully informing oneself before communicating.

         Principle of Attention: The receiver must understand the message clearly for communication
         to be successful. Simply transferring information is not enough; the receiver needs to be
         attentive and interested in the message.
